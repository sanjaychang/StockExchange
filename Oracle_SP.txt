SELECT *
  FROM YOUR_TABLE
 WHERE creation_date <= TRUNC(SYSDATE) - 30
SYSDATE returns the date & time; TRUNC resets the date to being as of midnight so you can omit it if you want the creation_date that is 30 days previous including the current time.

Depending on your needs, you could also look at using ADD_MONTHS:

SELECT *
  FROM YOUR_TABLE
 WHERE creation_date <= ADD_MONTHS(TRUNC(SYSDATE), -1)
 
 
 UPDATE  mytable
SET     campaign_status = 6
WHERE   campaign_Date <= DATEADD(day, -90, GETDATE())

UPDATE MESSAGE_LOG
SET INPROGRESS ='A'
WHERE creation_date <= TRUNC(SYSDATE) - 30



CREATE PROC sp_Campaign_Archive AS

    UPDATE [Campaign Table]
    SET Campaign_Status = 6
    WHERE DateDiff(day,Campaign_Date,GetDate()) >= 90

GO


SELECT campaign_date
FROM myTable
WHERE DATEDIFF(d, campaign_date, getdate()) >= 90
